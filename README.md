# Pizza Order UI

A small React project that displays a list of pizzas and shows a confirmation toast when a pizza is ordered.

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Tech Used

- React + TypeScript  
- Bootstrap 5  
- React‑Bootstrap  
- JSON data for pizza items  

## How It Works

- Pizza data is loaded from `data.json`
- Each pizza is shown using `PizzaCard`
- Clicking “Order” triggers a toast
- The toast appears for 3 seconds and then hides automatically

## File Structure

```
src/
  App.tsx
  App.sass
  data.json
  components/
    PizzaCard.tsx
    Confirm.tsx
```

## Features

- Simple pizza list UI  
- Click‑to‑order interaction  
- Floating confirmation toast
